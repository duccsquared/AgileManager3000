# Agile Manager 3000

A website for organizing an agile project into sprints and tasks, along with managing and allocating team members

This website was created within a group for a university project, for which I mainly worked on the backend of, including how the website accesses the FireBase database that we use, creating and modifying tasks, and allocating them to team members with time tracking.
